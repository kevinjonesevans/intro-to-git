## A Brief History Lesson

> A Unix "shell" is a command-line interpreter that provides a traditional user interface for the Unix operating system and for Unix-like systems.

* There are a [bunch of different shells](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/l-linux-shells/figure1.gif)... Bourne shell, C shell, Korn shell, Z shell, etc.
* The first major shell was the Bourne Shell, developed in the late 70's.
* We're going to focus on the "Bourne again shell" or _Bash_ (default shell for OSX and Linux)

_Hint: You can install Bash bindings in Windows via [Git for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/)_

## Why Bash?

* A fully-capable scripting language
* Vast adoption (approximately [70% of public servers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usage_share_of_operating_systems#Public_servers_on_the_Internet) are Unix or Unix-like)
* Tons of command line features...
    * Tab completion
    * Pipes
    * Aliases
    * Environment variables
    * Startup scripts
    * ...and more!

The outline below is provided as a handy reference of the commands we'll cover in class. [This tutorial](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-bash) contains alot of additional information if you're confused or just curious.
