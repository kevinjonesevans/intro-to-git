## Class Overview

* What is version control?
* Using the command line
* Git in practice

---

## The Problem

> Software projects have lots of files and often require multiple developers making updates to the same codebase.

Leads to bugs, accidental overwrites. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Who changed what? when? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* How to merge your code and mine? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Collaborating remotely is hard. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## The Solution

> **"Version Control"** is a system that records changes to files over time.

* Track every change to every file. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Manage multiple versions of file(s). <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Who added/edited/deleted what? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Attach descriptive messages to each change. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Types of Version Control

> Over the years, different strategies for version control have evolved.

Two types of version control systems:

**Centralized** and **Distributed**

---

## Centralized

Assumes a single "central" copy of your project somewhere (probably on a server), and programmers will "commit" their changes to this central copy.  

_Examples include **Subversion, CVS** and **SourceSafe**_

---

## Distributed

Doesn't rely on a central server. Every developer "clones" a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive.  
<br>

_Examples include **Bazaar, Mercurial** and **Git**_

## Why Git?

> ...designed to manage everything for small or large projects with speed &amp; efficiency.

1. Easy to learn <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
